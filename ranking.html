			<h3>About Leaderboard</h3>
			<p>Welcome to the E-Week org leaderboard!
Engineering orgs participating in E-Week score points in the attendance, placement, hosting, and 'additional points' categories.
The more sign-ins an org has at each event, the higher that org's attendance points. Placement points are earned by going to other orgs events and winning in competition. Orgs will earn hosting points by putting on the events they host well. Lastly, additional points are earned at special events, such as Dr. Ramshorn, and Quest.
Large orgs and small orgs compete seperately, so they have different leaderboards.
Scores are updated multiple times throughout each day.
Please also note that points are awarded at SEC's discretion and cheating will be punished severely.
Thanks for participating in E-Week!</p>
